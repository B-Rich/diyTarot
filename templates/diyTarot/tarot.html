  <h1>What's tarot?</h1>
  
  <p>Have you ever had something that didn't work out&mdash;it just <em>wasn't
   in the cards?</em> </p>

  the <a href="/diytarot/cards/52/1/">3 of Swords</a> knows!
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot">Tarot cards</a> (not to be confused with 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro">Taro root</a>) are a set of 
  78 playing cards which are associated with fortune-telling and the occult. Tarot also appeals to fans of
  art and symbolism: in most decks every single card is individually illustrated! 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The idea is that each tarot card represents a concept or event, and the image shown is chosen accordingly.
    For example, the Three of Swords card (see right) is supposed to represent 
    heartbreak, and <a href="/diytarot/cards/1/">the Rider-Waite deck</a>
  depicts this as a heart pierced by three swords. To add another layer of meaning, most people also interpet
  a card differently if it is upside-down, or <dfn>reversed</dfn>.

  <h2>Arcane Arcana</h2>
  
  <p>The 78 cards are organized into two sets known
  as <dfn>Arcana</dfn>, which is a cool-sounding word meaning secrets or mysteries. </p>
  
  <p>The first Arcana is called the <dfn>Major Arcana</dfn>, which is numbered from
    0 to 21 and consists of cards with mysterious, portentuous names like 
    The Hanged Man and The High Priestess. In card games these would serve as a trump suit. In 
    interpretations, many believe the major arcana cards represent archetypal personality traits and
    key, influential events.

  Of Looking Down Sadly
  </p>
 
  <p>The second Arcana is the <dfn>Minor Arcana</dfn>, and it is divided into four suits just like normal 
      playing cards. The suits have many names, and many decks reinvent them, but they usually involve
      the four elements: fire (Wands, Rods), water (Cups, Chalices), 
      air (Swords, Blades),  and earth (Pentacles, Coins). In addition to different names, the Minor
      Arcana suits also have four <dfn>court cards</dfn> each: a Page, Knight, Queen, and King. Traditional
      intepretation holds that these cards represent individual people, and the rest of the minors
      represent everyday events and emotions.

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Like everything else, tarot has its jargon. I learned the lingo from the great 
    <a href="http://www.tarotforum.net/">forum at Aeclectic Tarot</a>
 and lots of tarot books from the libary. Now I can pass on the knowledge to you!
 </p>
 
<h3>the Querent</h3>
<p>This is probably the first official tarot term I learned. It refers of course to the person 
  requesting the reading (most likely you and maybe your friends).
</p>

<h3>the Question</h3>
<p>This isn't really a tarot-specific term, but I put in here anyway because in tarot readings it's
  important to put a lot of thought into the questions you ask. The most useful ones are neither too broad
  ("Where will I be 10 years from now?") nor too specific ("When will I get promoted?"). Seem difficult?
  Don't worry, it gets easier with practice! Also, a lot of modern <dfn>spreads</dfn> (see below) actually
  define the question for you based on the card positions.
</p>

   title="The answer to a poorly phrased Ultimate Question">
  Ask a silly question, <br>
  get a silly answer.
</p>

<h3>Spread</h3>
 <p>A way of spreading out the cards, with titles and meanings associated with each one. 
   The Celtic Cross is a well-known one, but people are making up cool new ones all the time!
   Check out <a href="/diytarot/spreads/">the spreads section</a> to do a reading with the ones
   I've found.
 </p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>This refers to the full interpretation of a particular set of cards (probably based on a spread, 
  but maybe not) in the context of the Question. It also usually takes into account the deck used,
  since different decks have different moods and even ways of interpreting individual cards.
  For an example of a totally different vibe in deck, see <a href="/diytarot/decks/3">the Dessert Deck</a>.
</p>
 
<h3>Throw</h3>
 <p>This term refers to the act of drawing the cards one by one and laying them down according to the spread.
   It can also be used as a noun to refer to a whole set of cards ("what a bad throw...
   I'm going to redo this one!"). The difference between a throw and a reading is that a 
   reading involves intepretation according to the context.
